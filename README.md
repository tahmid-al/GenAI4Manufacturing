# GenAI_Manufacturing_Advanced

A full deep learning project for predictive maintenance using NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine datasets.

- LSTM-based RUL (Remaining Useful Life) prediction
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Jupyter notebook demo
- Streamlit inference app
- Modular, clean, and professional for GitHub/portfolio

**Instructions:**  
- Place your raw data files in `/data`
- Run preprocessing: `python scripts/preprocess_cmapps.py`
- Train LSTM: `python scripts/train_lstm.py`
- See detailed steps in `notebooks/eda_and_training_demo.ipynb`
